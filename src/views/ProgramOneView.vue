This local unrest intersects with global crises: the ongoing genocide in Palestine, the war in Ukraine, the murder of thousands for resource extraction in the Amazon, Congo and other regions, and the relentless destruction of nature.
The films in this block originate from diverse contexts and come together to create a collective, choral-like voice addressing these turbulent times. They form a unified critique of what the indigenous Nasa people in Colombia describe as the "death project" - a system that perpetuates violence, exploitation and environmental devastation.`,

      <strong>Holy Time</strong> Registro Contracultural | 2019 | 7 min
      <br/>
      “Holy Time” is a post-porn, anti-clerical, elegant, and folkloric video performance. It includes BDSM practices. The action is a ritual of profound love, complicity, and submission between Mistress Miranda, her friend and apprentice Maracx Bastardx, and the new submissive, Mass. It was performed live on April 12, 2019, at the BDSM Auch event in Santiago, Chile.

      <strong>SOLO</strong> | Andrés Valenzuela | 2024 | Chile | 63’ 
      <br/>
      Through the life of Ed, an erotic performer from Chile, Andrés Valenzuela crafts a homage to anal pleasure and to the queer community at the heart of Chile’s post-porn scene. SOLO is a film that explores worlds and bodies in flux—contracting and expanding, inviting communal encounters, yet at times seeking solitude, to simply be "solo."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Andrés Valenzuela</strong>: Santiago, Chile, 1982. Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
      Multidisciplinary "marika" artist. Creator of the web archive registrocontracultural.com, a platform dedicated to the digital preservation of Latin American, sex-dissident artistic memories. 
      Valenzuela works with members of the LGBTQI+ community and allies in both Chile and Argentina, supporting an activist and integrative approach toward collective development within society. Since 2019, they have collaborated with various artists and collectives, establishing a consistent work as a videographer and filmmaker documenting artistic expressions from the local transfeminist scene and sexual dissidence activism.
