        Moreover, the 2025 edition of the festival recognises the nature of the new Dutch government as it stands openly against plurality in all its forms. Porn Film Festival Amsterdam stands as a beacon of resistance against these tendencies, offering a platform for artistic and sexual exploration.

          <p class="text">
            For each edition, our festival receives more than 200 movies, mostly short films. Through the viewing process, we notice topics or themes that create dialogues between one film and the other. These findings are of course crossed by our personal paths, and what we find as a group important to share with the local audience. 
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            We are open to receiving films that were screened already at other porn film festivals or films from different times. Our local audience might not have seen it, so please send us also those older films!
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            Besides the curatorial work that the core-team of the festival puts together, we also invite guest curators. They present programs focused on countries, movements, archives, and others.

            We are a group of debauchees, cinephiles, activists, filmmakers, media scholars, and sex worker(s). Most of us met some years ago at Filmhuis Cavia in Amsterdam, a community-run cinema founded by the squatters movement of the 80s. 
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Finally, in 2024, our festival came to life with the tremendous support of the local and global porn community, as well as the trust of local funds and cultural grassroots venues. Two new people joined the gang, helping us greatly with our digital outreach and co-ordinating the lovely team of volunteers who make this festival possible.
