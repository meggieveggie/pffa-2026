    Do you remember your first crush? Was it on a cartoon character? Mine was Chel from The Road to El Dorado.

    Animated porn offers a perceived safety and morality. In a world where pornography isn’t always ethically produced, the humanless aspect of animation helps it feel victimless and enables us to take less accountability for our tastes and sexual interests; offering additional freedom to explore different gendered and otherwise ostracised interests. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Animation simply allows us to explore with truly no limits; socialised or anatomical.

    If The Garden of Earthly Delights was repainted today, what games would we play in the high grass? Which creatures would be lurking behind the trees? And what are the many potentials of a pitchfork?
    </p>
    <p>
    A garden is a dream, the fantasy of a submissive nature. One we can indulge in without being devoured alive. Behind hedges and fences we safely enjoy the sun on our skins, the humming of bees, the smell of warm soil, and mangoes growing big and juicy. But nature loves to lash back at us. Every dom knows their role should be a caring one, but when society's problems creep into our gardens like weeds, perhaps it’s time to reverse the roles, get on our knees and kiss a rock or two.

    Think of the most stereotypical porn and chances are a tired trope will spring to mind. But what if we queer it up? The hot hitchhiker, the stranger at the door, the sweaty gardener and, of course, the plumber. They all come along in this selection, sometimes parodying but mostly elevating the traditional roles in porn. Because, let’s be honest, it’s not easy to invent ground-breaking plots when it comes down to explicit scenes, so why not spice up the classics? These steamy flicks reignite the thrill of the unexpected encounter.

    This block is a dedication to all those lovers, one-night stands, exes and crushes we simply cannot get out of our heads. Their touches, kisses, words, smells are now written in our bodies. Memories of these (possible) encounters resurface without warning, pulling us into intense sensual fantasies that feel impossible to escape. Yet, we know we must break free from these dreams. They are often stained by the dynamics of sexual and gendered power imbalances or are simply unattainable ghosts of passion that can never be recaptured in our beds.

    Have our Gods abandoned us, or did we abandon them? Is it time to reconsider the ideals we’ve followed and the stories that shaped us? These films all shed a new light upon the ancient myths that lie at the roots of modern Western societies, of capitalism and colonialism. We used to sit around the fire, sharing stories and myths, and calling upon entities from other planes for spiritual insights and healing. Today, our faces are lit by phone screens ‘invoking’ influencers, podcasts and YouTube tutorials for guidance. But if we’d summon those old European deities and mythical creatures once more, how would they speak to us?

    Power dynamics are woven through the tapestry of our daily lives, yet we often have little awareness of the forces at play. It can be difficult to express our desires due to societal restrictions placed around unconventional appetites. Kink and BDSM practices seek to oust the fears surrounding these yearnings. Consent is the foundation for these interactions, ensuring safe exploration of limits while highlighting the significance and sexiness of open communication. These films seek to enhance understanding of the sometimes complex narratives of kink, challenging conventional views of relationships. By using dominance, pain, submission, control and service as a way to achieve balance, we push ourselves and each other to the outermost physical limits as a way to explore our innermost personal depths.
