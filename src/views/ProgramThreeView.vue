    "text": `Film is a striptease – now you see it, now you don’t – film is about voyeurism and the desire to see more, to see what shouldn’t be seen. This selection of experimental 16mm and 35mm movies all work with different techniques and approaches in an effort to question the medium and to explore the textures and rhythms of the film material. Nudity and pornography have been a mainstream of the medium since its beginnings, as well as its censorship. Showing pornography on older film formats recalls the medium's underground origins, in which experimentation flourishes outside of commercial constraints. Such screenings become acts of cultural archaeology, connecting audiences to the medium’s layered histories while fostering critical discourse on representation, agency, and the politics of desire. `,

    Who imposes sex and its culture on which body? How many gendered, aged, racialised and disabled bodies are excluded from heteronormative love as the sole and default expression of intimacy? Listening to the beautiful words of Sami Schalk, author of Black Disability Politics, “we would all benefit from an approach that takes each other's body, each sexual interaction, as new, figuring out what is best with this person in this moment, given how their body feels and what's on their mind.”
    <p>
    Cripping Pleasure invites us to experience crip time in cinema. Can we, through film, reimagine our notions of what can and should happen in time? Can we change the expectations we’ve learned to take for granted with our own bodies?

    During Brazil’s military dictatorship (1964–1985), censorship stifled creative freedom, yet some filmmakers found ways to subvert it. The pornochanchada, a B-movie genre known for its blend of eroticism and comedy, often served as a smokescreen for more daring narratives. The recently rediscovered Os Homens Que Eu Tive is one such remarkable work, disguised as a lighthearted erotic film hiding a bold feminist core.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    Written, edited, and directed by Tereza Trautman, the film was censored after just six weeks of screening and later re-released in 1980 under the title Os Homens e Eu. Its open exploration of female sexuality, free love, and other taboo topics posed a direct challenge to the patriarchal bourgeois ideals of the time, branding it a “moral threat.”

    According to the Four Pillars of Destiny, an ancient East Asian astrology, our fortune is made of five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. But no one’s fortune is full, there is always one or more elements missing. To overcome this, we need to find our missing elements outside, by making kinship with objects that contain the missing elements, pleasing ourselves with them. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In this block, you can see how objects can create not simply slimy, squishy or piercing imagery but evoke social emotions that are carried through our bodymind - cheeky, dreamy or toxic. By following the advice of a vibrator, the sprinkle of a cherry on top or a confession of an eargasm, you may find that objects counterbalance a lack in our fortune. It is a beautiful way of acknowledging that nothing is perfect and we all have to co-constitute relationships between flesh and environment.`,

    Brazil's love motels are a haven where fantasy becomes reality. When the filmmaker's own date never shows up, she gets a fresh idea for a film instead.

    <br/>
    Filmed by the protagonists themselves, Eros presents a unique glimpse into the singular stories of people living their intimacy and romance in the privacy of motels, while these behaviours reflect broad social realities. Highly personal and often explicit, the result is a kaleidoscopic insight into a parallel world of human desire.

      Limited to 10 participants, this workshop offers hands-on experience in writing sensual, provocative scripts and bringing them to life through sound. You’ll experiment with voice work, sound effects, and music choices to craft intimate, evocative audio narratives. Whether you're new to audio creation or a seasoned storyteller, come explore the erotic potential of sound.

      Cruising queers comes in two parts. We kick off with a creative personal ad-crafting workshop on Friday at PIC. The second part is an intimate collective reading session during the film block CRUISING THE CITY (Saturday 8th, 13:00, Theater de Richel).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      On Friday we invite participants to get creative with filth, scissors and stationery to craft their own smutty personal-ads on paper cards. Guided by Sára and Katinka and Eddie, we will read together, write together, share fantasies, markers and glue sticks. Each person can bring something that they want to use in their personal ad – a talisman that speaks to their sexuality or desire. The aim is to create a ‘cruising wall’; or message board that will display the finished cards on site at PFFA where visitors can read/respond to them.
